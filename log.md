### Day 4: June 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Brain feels overworked and tired ðŸ˜´ Really want to take a day off. Picked out the colour scheme for the tour guide app, added the icons and coded a bare-bones structure. Feels like it took way waaay too long to do such simple things but hopefully, with practice I'll get faster at this.

### Day 6: July 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: developing the tour guide app. Learned how to convert my ListView to a RecyclerView today thanks to TheBaileyBrew's handy demo (https://github.com/TheBaileyBrew/Angry_Nerds_Demo_Recycler) then adapted it to use fragments. Happy with today's progress!
