### Day 4: June 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Brain feels overworked and tired üò¥ Really want to take a day off. Picked out the colour scheme for the tour guide app, added the icons and coded a bare-bones structure. Feels like it took way waaay too long to do such simple things but hopefully, with practice I'll get faster at this.

### Day 6: July 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: developing the tour guide app. Learned how to convert my ListView to a RecyclerView today thanks to TheBaileyBrew's handy demo (https://github.com/TheBaileyBrew/Angry_Nerds_Demo_Recycler) then adapted it to use fragments. Happy with today's progress!

### Day 8: July 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: < 2 days to deadline for the tour guide app.  When a venue in the RecyclerView is selected it now goes to a new activity  & passes the vars across without error. Had fun on the design for the new activity!

### Day 13: July 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Starting lessons on JSON parsing, opening a whole new world of possibilities! I was nervous about the next project but feeling inspired to create my news app after seeing @TheBaileyBrew's technical masterpiece today! 

### Day 14: July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Applied some recommendations from the #Udacity project reviewer to my Tour Guide app to improve it. I do this with all projects because I like to harvest their shiny organs to use in other projects to save time. 

### Day 15: July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: imported the Earthquake app from #udacity's repo. Also tried to create a custom Java class for my tour guide's database so that I can use only one FragmentAdapter, and have tabs search by category.  Still battling with it thanks to context().

### Day 16: July 12, 2018 ###

**Today's Progress**: Quite a bit behind this week due to visiting family in the hospital and other stuff going on, but managed to squeeze in an hour tonight to learn a bit more about JSON.  Plan to forge ahead Friday night! Since13 is my lucky number :)
