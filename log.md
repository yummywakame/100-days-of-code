# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## Grow with Google Udacity Developer Challenge

### Day 1: June 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added up buttons to the Miwok language app. Learned about fragments and ViewPager. Started refactoring the Miwok app to use fragments instead of separate activities.

**Thoughts:** Today went faster than usual.
